/**
 * listDirectoryContents - List the contents of the directory at the specified path on an endpoint’s filesystem. The endpoint must be activated before performing this operation.
 *
 * The path is specified in the path query parameter. If the parameter is not passed, the default path depends on the type of endpoint
 *
 * @param  {string} bearerToken       Token authorized by globus.org.
 * @param  {string} endpoint_xid      The id of the endpoint you'd like to get an ACL from.
 * @param  {string} path              (**OPTIONAL**) For shared endpoints, S3 endpoints, and anonymous FTP endpoints, the default is /. For GridFTP endpoints, the default is /~/. Most of the time this will map to the user’s home directory. However the administrator of the GridFTP server can configure it to point elsewhere. Also as a special case, if the restricted paths configuration on the server does not allow the user’s home directory, it will fall back to /.
 * @param  {string} query_parameters  (**OPTIONAL**) Added on query parameters to the end of the string (must be prefixed with an ampersand).  [Link](https://docs.globus.org/api/transfer/file_operations/#dir_listing_query_parameters)
 * @return {promise}             containing the body of the response.
